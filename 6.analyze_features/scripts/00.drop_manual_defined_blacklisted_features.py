# We want to remove features that do not accuratly contribute to the shape variance.

#
# Spatial moment features are removed as they are not invariant to rotation and translation.
#
# Central moment features are removed as size is not of interest.
#
# Normalized moment features are removed as they do not contribute to the shape variance.
#
# EulerNumber is removed as we are not concerned with the number of holes in the shape.
#
# Extent is removed as we do not care about the ratio of pixels in the bounding box to the pixels in the shape.
#
# Orientation is removed as we are not concerned with the angle of the major axis of the shape.
